This project should be used to facilitate some actions for the application to store data into the DB
It will encode chat messages that will be stored in the DB
It will decode chat messages that are stored in the DB
It will Hash the password with different algorithms, currently using BCrypt and a work factor.
These steps are really basic, do not use this for production just an example on how encode/decode data going into a DB.
